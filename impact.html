        <h4 style="font-weight: 100;">Hi again, I'm Cullen (he/his/they). I believe that the key to solving complex problems
          lies in understanding the breadth of experience that users have when intersecting with a built environment. Along the way, my goal is to build connections, seek different 
          viewpoints, and eventually eliminate barriers to seamless accessibility and usability. Thus, I love studying the how we interact with the world
          around us, how we structure systems to that environment, and investigating new and difficult spaces.</h4>

          <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">My Beginnings</h2>
          <br>
          <h4>I first learned how to translate my research abilities into UX contexts as a barista. 
            As a recent grad at the new coffee shop in town, I became aware of all the pain points 
            that a budding business encounters, from 
            point of sales system software to the cultivation of complex online consumer relationships. I was able to 
            utilize my abilities as a historian, researcher, and writer, to better understand these pain points, garner insights
            from them, and drive information throughout the business. As my work took me to Quicken Loans and 
            a policy non-profit, I knew there was more to this method of understanding and improving
            relationships between various users and systems -- and found user experience research and design along the way.</h4>

          <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">My Journey</h2>
          <br>
          <h4>I began my graduate studies in 2019 with a focus in library sciences, as I was unsure how
            to translate my skills as a historical researcher into those of a UX researcher. 
            As 2020 arrived, I had an archival internship, but still felt drawn towards UX research. 
            When my internship was cancelled (COVID-19), I was accepted into a UX research fellowship, 
            where I worked to better connect the residents of Lansing, MI, to public services. 
            I took that experience into a UX research class (SI 622) in the fall, where I performed usability testing
            with at-risk families for a financial tech nonprofit. Several projects later, 
            I was chosen to teach SI 622 -- the class that certified my passion for UX research -- 
            and graduated with a focus in UX research in May 2021. </h>
